Hi there :wave: Thank you for being here! 

Hi, I'm Paula! I'm a **DevOps Engineer** and independent researcher. I'm passionate about automation and love using Python to make things easier. In my free time, I do research on the state of technology in developing countries in South America. I'm also an embroidery hobbyist and occasional guitar player.
