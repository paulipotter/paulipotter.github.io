I've wanted to have a personal website *for so long* now! It's almost embarrassing that, as a programmer, I haven't had *some* sort of website. All summer, I pondered between *flexing my Python skills* and creating a Flask website or rely on a simpler, quicker version that gets me the desired result without hassle.

Although creating a Flask website is a fantastic idea, it may not be the most time-efficient decision, and boy, it takes time. I even created (and almost finished!) a [Flask+Bootstrap site](https://github.com/paulipotter/Flask-Website/tree/main) with *my own color palette and customized theme.* It wasn't until I almost reached the final stages (ironically, that meant setting up the blog's database and CSS) that it hit me. Worst of all is that I *already had* this website up! It just wasn't being used to its fullest potential.

### A non-comprehensive list of reasons why I ended up choosing GitHub Pages:
- Free hosting service
- Free domain! `your_account_name.github.io`
- CI/CD using Built-In Github Actions marketplace plugins
- Option to use `markdown`, `HTML`, or mix them both in a `.md` file!
- Overall quick code-to-deploy turnaround
