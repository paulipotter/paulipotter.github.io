# Hi there! so long no see?

I've been a bit MIA but I'm back, I hope. In my defense, I've been busy. Today is a big day because it's my first day as DevOps engineer at Black Spectacles, and I just could not be more excited!

Either way, I'm hoping to come back and fontinue working on the last days of Dr. Angela Yu's 100 days of Python Code. 

See you around! 👋🏻
