Introducing Python-Projects: A Collection of Python Snippets

In the quest to expand my coding skills and showcase my expertise, I have created a repository called python-projects on GitHub. This repository houses various small Python snippets that I have worked on over time.

Let's take a closer look at some of the projects featured in this repository:

| Name | Description | URL  |
|---|---|---|
| Binary Trees | Various binary tree sorting and trimming activities | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/paulipotter/python-projects/tree/main/binary-tree) |
| Implementing a data structure | Write a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of said structure. | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/paulipotter/python-projects/tree/main/implement-data-structure) |
| Pascal Triangle | Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/paulipotter/python-projects/tree/main/pascal-triangle) |
| Two Sum | Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. | [ðŸ”—](https://github.com/paulipotter/python-projects/tree/main/two-sum) |
