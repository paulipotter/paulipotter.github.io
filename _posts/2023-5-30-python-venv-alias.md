Simplify Your Virtual Environment Workflow with Zsh Aliases

Managing virtual environments is an essential part of many development workflows. However, constantly typing out the full command to activate or create a virtual environment can be time-consuming and cumbersome. Thankfully, there's a solution that can streamline your workflow in the Zsh shell.

By adding a few lines to your `.zshrc` file, you can create custom aliases that simplify the process. Inspired by a helpful gist found at [this link](https://gist.github.com/haridas/4966347), I have created [my own version](https://gist.github.com/paulipotter/3d4fe8b17ec18faad1336fbcdcc10e66) of these aliases. At the end of your `.zshrc`, add the following:
```shell
alias activate='source .venv/bin/activate || echo "no venv available in current folder"'
alias mkenv='python3 -m venv .venv 2>/dev/null && echo "Virtual environment created." || echo "venv already exists"'
alias rmenv='rm -rf .venv && echo "venv removed." || echo "No venv available in current folder"'
```
Make sure you restart your terminal before you test it out.

### Usage

| Command | Description | Longer Command |
|---|---|---|
| `mkenv` | Creates a new virtual environment | `python3 -m venv .venv` |
| `activate` | Activate your virtual environment | `source ./.venv/bin/activate`|
| `rmenv` | Removes the virtual environment if it exists. | `rm -rf .venv` |

By simplifying the process of working with virtual environments, these aliases can save you valuable time and keystrokes.

Give these aliases a try and experience a more efficient virtual environment workflow in your Zsh shell!
